# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction-

As an example of cross-selling methods, this initiative seeks to forecast healthcare insurance
customers who are likely to be interested in purchasing automobile insurance. We utilized a
dataset including over 381,000 samples, as well as 12 different variables such as demographics
and vehicle details. The Age and Annual Premium variables are scaled using the min-max
scaling approach, while the Gender, Vehicle Age, and Vehicle Damage data are label encoded.
To oversample and balance the dataset, the SOMTE approach described below is utilized.
We trained and performed hyper tuning of the Decision tree, Random Forest, Logistic regression,
XGBoost, KNN, Linear SVC and ANN algorithms to predict the target variable. We have
generated the classification report after training the models to get the model's accuracy both with
training and testing data sets.
This research is arranged as follows, basic information offers complete literature analysis about
cross-selling and briefly examines relevant studies released in the recent 5 years. Material and
methods section provides the approaches and procedures for cross-selling forecasts. In result and
discussion, prediction results of algorithms were shown related two categorization metrics and
lastly, discussion and conclusion portion summarizes the research and offers other possibilities to
expand the study.
